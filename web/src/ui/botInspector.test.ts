// SSR render checks for the Bot Builder's INSPECTOR, rendered directly.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM botBuilderPanel.test.ts. The inspector
// only appears once a row is selected, and the SSR harness renders once and
// cannot click — so rendering the PANEL never reaches it, and the argument
// widgets (the single largest piece of template in the builder, and the piece
// that used to be a hand-written per-macro chain with three arguments missing
// from it entirely) would have no coverage at all. Rendering the component
// directly is the only way to see them, and it needs no test-only seam: the
// inspector holds no state and takes everything it draws as a prop.
//
// What it is really pinning: that `ARG_KIND_WIDGET`'s promise is kept. That
// table makes a missing widget a COMPILE error in editorOptions.ts; these
// tests make a widget that compiles but renders nothing a TEST failure.
